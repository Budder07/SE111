        <h1>Zachary LaChapelle </h1> 
        <p>My name is <strong>Zachary LaChapelle.</strong> I live in Warwick, Rhode Island. I attend <em>New England Institute of Technology</em> and am enrolled in the Networking and Cyber security Engineering Major. 
            I was drawn to NEIT due to my credits having the ability to transfer from my high school and the quality of the program I am enrolled in.  
            I am currently on my third term in my NEIT career. I hope to pursue the career that my degree is intended for. I have an interest in job positions aligning with a the job description of a SOC analyst.
